The 9 Barista Espresso Machine is a stove top espresso maker that uses a two-chamber system to create espresso. The bottom chamber boils the water, while the upper chamber acts as a cooling bath. When the water in the bottom chamber reaches nine bars of pressure, it flows into the coil in the upper chamber and is then cooled, creating espresso.

The nine barista is a stove top espresso maker that comes with an adapter disc for gas or induction hobs. It also comes with a tamper and a small gas burner. To use, simply brew some coffee and taste it. Afterwards, give your overall thoughts on the coffee.

To prep the AeroPress, they recommend 20 grams of coffee. However, many people prefer to use a slightly lower dose of around 18.5-19 grams. The tamp is important for evenly distributing the coffee. The dispersion screen helps to keep the coffee in when you turn the AeroPress upside down. The biggest challenge of using the AeroPress is that it can take a while to dial in your process, particularly if you are brewing back-to-back coffees. It is important to hit the recommended brew time of six minutes, or else you risk either evaporating all the water in your upper chamber or insufficiently cooling your brew.
